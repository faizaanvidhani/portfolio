            Hi! I'm Faizaan (he/him/his). I’m a Dallas native with a passion for health technology, computer systems, and 
            clinical applications of AI. I attend <a className="home-link" href="https://www.brown.edu">Brown University</a>, 
            where I study <span className="home-important">neuroscience</span> and <span className="home-important">computer science</span> with 
            a focus in <span className="home-important">visual computing</span>. 
            </p>
            <p className="home-body-text">
            I have a diverse background in both industry and research. In the summer of 2022, I completed a <span className="home-important">Software Engineering</span> internship at&nbsp;
            <a className="home-link" href="https://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>, where I worked on the Access Engineering to design and deploy a KillSwitch to production.
            During my undergraduate years, I conducted both dry lab and wet lab research. In my first year, I had the opportunity to contribute to <span className="home-important">epilepsy research</span> at&nbsp;
            <a className="home-link" href="https://www.brown.edu/Research/asaad/">Rhode Island Hospital</a>, where I delved into the neural 
            processes involved in facial recognition by contributing to a movie-viewing task. During the summer after my sophomore year, I 
            conducted <span className="home-important">autism genetics research</span> at <a className="home-link" href="https://chahrourlab.org/index.html#home">UT Southwestern Medical Center</a>. 
            </p>
            <p className="home-body-text">
            I love tackling challenging problems in both the <span className="home-important">health</span> and <span className="home-important">tech</span> space. 
            Currently, I’m seeking opportunities at the intersection of these two fields.
